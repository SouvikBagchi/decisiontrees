<h3>This repository contains the following implementations of a very popular machine learning technique called the Decision Tree :</h3>
<h4>`ID3'</h4>
<h5>The ID3 algorithm uses *information gain* as a criteria to measure the strength of an attribute for the target classification.</h5>

<h6>*information gain* = - p<sub>+</sub>log<sub>2</sub>p<sub>+</sub> - p<sub>-</sub>log<sub>2</sub>p<sub>-</sub></h6>
